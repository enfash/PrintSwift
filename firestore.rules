/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for a printing service application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model where only users
 * designated as "admins" have CRUD access to product categories, products,
 * and quote requests. Admin status is determined by the existence of a
 * document in the `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/roles_admin/{uid}`:  Admin user IDs. Existence of a document grants admin role.
 * - `/product_categories/{productCategoryId}`: Stores product category information.
 * - `/products/{productId}`: Stores product information.
 * - `/quote_requests/{quoteRequestId}`: Stores customer quote requests.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin-Only Access: All data under `/product_categories`, `/products`,
 *   and `/quote_requests` is only accessible to admin users.
 * - No Public Data: There is no public data in this application.
 * - Admin Role by Existence: Admin privileges are granted solely based on
 *   the existence of a document in `/roles_admin/{uid}`, not its content.
